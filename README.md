  <b>Our initiative was not for commercial purposes and does not encourage investment in NFTs <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/774410/heres-the-problem-with-nfts/">(in fact, it is rather an advice not to do so)</a>, at least not in the current state of the market</b>.<br>

  This project was aimed to learn how to <b>build products on the blockchain</b> and to deploy them in order to learn more about <b>web3</b>.<br>
